📊 Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project

A complete end-to-end analytics workflow using Python, SQL & Power BI

🔍 Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using a full data-analytics lifecycle. It includes loading the dataset in Python, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning the data, running SQL queries using PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server, creating a Power BI dashboard, and generating insights. A final project presentation is prepared using Gamma/PowerPoint.

This repository demonstrates real-world analytics skills — data cleaning, SQL, visualization, dashboarding, and reporting — ideal for portfolio and interview use.
